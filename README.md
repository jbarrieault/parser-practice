# Parser Practice

This is a playground for me to practice things relating to the implementation of lexing and parsing.

### Patterns to explore
- [ ] Recursive descent
- [ ] AST construction and traversal
- [ ] Streaming / Buffered parsing

### Application
- [ ] JSON parser in Ruby
- [ ] JSON parser in Go
- [ ] JSON parser in C
- [ ] YAML parser in my dreams
- [ ] SQL parser
